# leetcode-problem-picker

## Purpose:
This project was a response to my reoccurring question *"Which leetcode problem should I do next?"*

Over time I found that the answer varies, depending on progress, needs, and goals:
1. **Topic Focus**: Narrow down to 1+ subjects e.g. "only do problems related to graphs or DP".
2. **Filtered Lists**: Honing in on questions asked by desired companies. Applies to lists like Blind's Curated 75.
3. **Level Up** (WIP): Deduces user's "skill range" for each topic in order to challenge (but not discourage).
4. **Weighted random** (TODO): Weighted towards questions with high like count, greater like/dislike ratio, etc.

## Setup:
```git clone https://github.com/evliang/leetcode-problem-picker.git```

## Usage:
```python lcpp.py [-t stack trie graph dp] [--list airbnb google blind75 skipped] [-k 5] [-i]```

```
--topic_list -t     selects from a pool of problems associated with a subject (e.g. trie, greedy, graph)
--list -l           chooses problems from one or more text files (comma-delimited)
--num_problems -k   number of problems to get
--interactive -i    interactive mode. Preferred way to input data. See section below for more info.
note: no topic or list will result in a problem randomly being selected
```

```python lcpp.py problem_num```

Displays information about a specific problem: Name, difficulty, Acceptance rate, and a score related to how many companies ask it (last part is a TODO)

## Interactive Mode:
This mode selects and displays a single problem and waits for input:

```
info                displays details about problem. problem name, difficulty, acceptance rate
hint                displays related topics
y/n,num_errs,time   data regarding attempt. See Completed Problems section for more details
easy                mark as completed with low completion time, then selects a different problem
hard                adds to a hard/skipped list. selects a less similar, less challenging problem
revisit [ID]        mark problem as one to revisit later
refresh [ID]        mark problem as one to "refresh" on later
pause               pause the timer
break               take a break. restarts the timer
quit                stop the program
```

## Completed Problems (optional/recommended):
To maximize this program, you need to maintain a list of completed problems. This is to avoid being suggested problems youâ€™ve done before, and in the case of "Level Up," to select problems slightly out of comfort zone
This can be done in three ways:
1. completed.txt: Format is a comma-delimited list of problem numbers e.g. "78,5,13,1337". Very simple, but not compatible with "Level Up"
2. completed.csv: One problem, one line
Expected format: ```LC number, [was solved],[time],[date],[num_errors]```
```
LC number           integer. The only required field
was solved          string. valid inputs: y/n (or yes/no). case insensitive
time                integer. number of minutes spent on the problem
date                DateTime. date completed
num_errs            float. # mistakes made. Float to differentiate minor from major errors.
```
3. interactive mode: Solve a problem after it is assigned, then record results before getting the next problem. Appends results to completed.csv.
